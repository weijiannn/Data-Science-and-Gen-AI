Project 1: Data Preparation and Feature Engineering
Notebook: Project_1.ipynb
Dataset: UK Online Retail Transactions (Kaggle)

This project demonstrates the early stages of an end-to-end data science workflow on an e-commerce transaction dataset, focusing on:
1) Data understanding
2) Data cleaning and preparation
3) Feature engineering for customer-level analysis

The notebook explores common issues found in transactional e-commerce data, such as missing values, invalid transactions, and duplicated records. Raw transaction-level data is transformed into more informative features that can be used for downstream analysis and modelling.

This project supports discussion around data quality, preprocessing decisions, and the importance of feature engineering in e-commerce analytics.
