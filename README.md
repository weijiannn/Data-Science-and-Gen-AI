## Project 1: Data Preparation and Feature Engineering
Notebook: Project_1.ipynb
Dataset: UK Online Retail Transactions (Kaggle)

This project demonstrates the early stages of an end-to-end data science workflow on an e-commerce transaction dataset, focusing on:
1) Data understanding
2) Data cleaning and preparation
3) Feature engineering for customer-level analysis

The notebook explores common issues found in transactional e-commerce data, such as missing values, invalid transactions, and duplicated records. Raw transaction-level data is transformed into more informative features that can be used for downstream analysis and modelling.

This project supports discussion around data quality, preprocessing decisions, and the importance of feature engineering in e-commerce analytics.

## Project 2: Predictive Modelling for E-commerce Sales
Notebook: Project_2.ipynb
Dataset: Online Retail Data (Kaggle)

This project builds on prepared transactional data to demonstrate supervised machine learning techniques applied to e-commerce sales data. The focus is on:
1) Preparing data for modelling
2) Training and comparing regression-based models
3) Evaluating model performance using standard metrics

Rather than optimising for maximum predictive accuracy, this project emphasises model comparison, interpretation, and limitations. The notebook reflects how predictive models are commonly used in e-commerce as decision-support tools rather than fully automated decision-makers.

## Project 3: Introductory Natural Language Processing for Customer Reviews
Notebook: Project_3.ipynb
Dataset: Women’s Clothing E-Commerce Reviews (Kaggle)

This project demonstrates the application of introductory natural language processing techniques to an e-commerce customer reviews dataset, focusing on:
1) Text data understanding
2) Text preprocessing and representation
3) Basic sentiment modelling and evaluation

The notebook explores how unstructured customer review text can be transformed into structured features for analysis. It also highlights the limitations of sentiment analysis, including loss of nuance and challenges in interpreting customer intent.
